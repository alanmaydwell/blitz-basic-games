# blitz-basic-games

These are some games I wrote in 2002 or earlier in [Blitz Basic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blitz_BASIC).

Each folder holds a different game.

## How to run
The .bb source files can be executed in the Blitz Basic IDE, if you have it. I believe this is still a commercial application and it's not inclued here.

Each folder also has a .exe file which might work. However, these were created in 2002 or earlier. They may not work well with Windows 10. I've not yet tried this myself as I rarely use Windows.

I have found the .exe files run using Wine on Linux but I needed to set "Emulate a virtual desktop" in Wine Config to get the screen to display. Some of the games use midi file playback for music but this did not work under Wine.

## How to quit
If you do manage to run a game and want to quit, then pressing the Escape key should work. In the case of The Sprouter Limits it's necessary to hold the escape key for several seconds.
